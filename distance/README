distance
---------

calculates the distance between two atoms using MapReduce


pre-build:
==========

you must define several environment variables

NETCDF_HOME     := Damasc NetCDF library (e.g.
NETCDF_VERSION  := version of NetCDF
HADOOP_PREFIX   := location of Hadoop install
HADOOP_VERSION  := version of Hadoop
SCIHADOOP_HOME  := location of SciHadoop install

*Note: this build has been tested with Hadoop 2.6.0 and NetCDF 4.2
       for other versions you MAY need to make additional changes to build.xml

to build:
=========

ant jar


to use:
=======

hadoop jar </path/to>/GetDistance.jar <directory_with_netcdf_files> <output_directory> <atom1> <atom2>



=====
in my experience (15 node Hadoop cluster on 7200rpm spinning disks), using a serial program on a single hdd is faster up to about 100 GB trajectories. beyond that, this MR implementation starts winning.
